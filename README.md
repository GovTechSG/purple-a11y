## How Scanning Works

For a detailed explanation of how Oobee scans websites, what affects result accuracy, recommended hardware specs, and tips for getting the best coverage, see [CRAWL.md](./CRAWL.md). Recommended reading before running large scans.

## Using Oobee as a NodeJS module

If you wish to use Oobee as a NodeJS module that can be integrated with end-to-end testing frameworks, refer to the [integration guide](./INTEGRATION.md) on how you can do so.

## Prerequisites and Installations

### Portable Oobee

Portable Oobee is the recommended way to run Oobee as it reduces the difficulty for installation. Refer to [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md) for step-by-step instructions for portable Oobee.

### Manual Installation

Please ensure the following requirements are met:

#### Node.js

- A Node distribution of 20 (LTS) or above.
- To check your version of Node, go into terminal and paste the command bellow

```shell
node -v
```

- If you do not have node, or if there is a need to manage your node versions, you can consider using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). After NVM is installed, you can then install an LTS version of Node:

```shell
# Install NodeJS version with NVM
nvm install --lts

# For subsequent use, you will need to run the command below each time you open a new terminal
nvm use --lts
```

- Install the required NPM packages with `npm install`.
- Build the project with `npm run build` before you try to run it with `npm start`.

#### Java JRE/JDK

- A JRE/JDK distribution of version 11 or above.
- To check your version of Java, go into terminal and paste the command bellow

```shell
java --version
```

- If you do not have java, you can consider installing [Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/what-is-corretto-11.html) distribution of OpenJDK.

#### VeraPDF

- VeraPDF is used for scanning PDF files. Install VeraPDF by following the [install guide](https://docs.verapdf.org/install/). You may wish to use the Automated installation script provided on that page, and changing the XML installation script section `<installpath>/tmp/verapdf-test</installpath>` to a location of your choice.
- Ensure you have VeraPDF set in PATH then verify verapdf is installed correctly:

```shell
# Invoke the VeraPDF installer
# Windows users should use vera-install.bat instead of vera-install
./verapdf-install ./auto-install.xml

# Add VeraPDF to PATH. For subsequent use, you will need to run the command below each time you open a new terminal
export PATH="<location of verapdf>:$PATH"

# Verify verapdf is installed
verapdf --version
```

#### Environment variables (Optional)
| Variable Name | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| OOBEE_VERBOSE | When set to `true`, log output goes to console | `false` |
| OOBEE_FAST_CRAWLER| When set to `true`, increases scan concurrency at a rapid rate.  Experimental, may cause system stability issues on low-powered devices. | `false`|
| OOBEE_VALIDATE_URL| When set to `true`, validates if URLs are valid and exits. | `false` |
| OOBEE_LOGS_PATH | When set, logs are written to this path. |  |
| WARN_LEVEL | Only used in tests. |  |
| OOBEE_DISABLE_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD | Experimental flag to disable file downloads on Chrome/Chromium/Edge.  Does not affect Local File scan | |
| OOBEE_SLOWMO | Experimental flag to slow down web browser behaviour by specified duration (in miliseconds) | |
| OOBEE_TAGGED_WEBSITE | Tag to identify the website in telemetry. Can also be set via `-z, --websiteTag` CLI flag (CLI flag takes precedence). | |
| OOBEE_SCAN_METADATA | Overrides the `entryUrl` tag sent to telemetry. | |
| OOBEE_SCAN_PRODUCT | Adds a `scanProduct` tag to telemetry events. | |
| OOBEE_CONSECUTIVE_MAX_RETRIES | Max consecutive HTTP failures before the circuit breaker aborts the crawl. `0` disables this check. | `0` (disabled) |
| OOBEE_MAX_RATCHET_CYCLES | Max number of concurrency halvings without a full recovery before the crawl aborts. `0` disables this check. | `0` (disabled) |
| OOBEE_MAX_IDLE_MINUTES | Max minutes without a successful page scan before the crawl aborts and generates a partial report from pages already scanned. `0` disables this check. | `0` (disabled) |
| OOBEE_SAVE_DOM | Set to `1` or `true` to save full-page DOM HTML for each scanned page in both desktop and mobile viewports to the results directory. Mobile viewport width is determined from iPhone 11 device profile. Works with all scan types (Website, Sitemap, Intelligent, LocalFile, Custom). | |
| OOBEE_SAVE_PAGE_SCREENSHOT | Set to `1` or `true` to save full-page desktop and mobile viewport screenshots for each scanned page. Mobile viewport width is determined from iPhone 11 device profile. Works with all scan types (Website, Sitemap, Intelligent, LocalFile, Custom). | |
| HTTP_PROXY | URL of the proxy server to be used for HTTP requests (e.g. `http://proxy.example.com:8080`). | |
| HTTPS_PROXY | URL of the proxy server to be used for HTTPS requests (e.g. `https://proxy.example.com:8080`). | |
| ALL_PROXY | URL of the proxy server to be used for all requests, typically used for SOCKS5 proxies (e.g. `socks5://proxy.example.com:1080`. Note: IPv6 direct connections may still continue even though socks5 proxy is specified due to a known issue with Chrome/Chromium. (Recommended workaround is to turn off IPv6 at host-level). | |
| NO_PROXY | Comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy (e.g. `localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com`). | |
| INCLUDE_PROXY | Comma-separated list of domains that should specifically be routed through the proxy. | |
| CF_WORKER_PROXY | **Experimental.** URL of a Cloudflare Worker (e.g. `https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev`) that proxies Chromium traffic via a local SOCKS5 tunnel over WebSocket. TLS stays end-to-end (no MITM) and DNS resolves inside the worker. May help unblock some sites. Overrides `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`. See [examples/cf-worker-proxy.example.js](./examples/cf-worker-proxy.example.js) for the reference worker. | |
| CF_WORKER_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN | Optional. Sent as the `Authorization` header on the WebSocket upgrade to `CF_WORKER_PROXY`. | |
| CF_WORKER_PROXY_PORT | Optional. Local SOCKS5 bind port for the tunnel. | `8877` |
| CF_FAMILY_DNS | Optional. Resolves DNS queries through [Cloudflare Families DNS over HTTPS (DoH)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/) for safer browsing. Does not work when `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` is used.  | |
| GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING | When set, enables Google Safe Browsing URL protection. Blocks phishing, malware, and unwanted software URLs — blocked pages are classified as "Blocked by Safe Browsing" in reports. Requires Google Chrome (not Chromium or Edge). On macOS and Windows, copies the threat database from your system Chrome profile. On Docker Linux, connects to a pre-warmed Chrome instance. | |
| OOBEE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to opt out of **all** telemetry submissions (Google Form and Sentry). When set, PII (name, email, entry URL, userId) is never sent off-device. Also relaxes the `-k user:email` requirement so scans can run non-interactively without providing a name/email. | |
| OOBEE_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to allow the scanner to accept invalid/self-signed TLS certificates on scanned targets. Only takes effect when no credentials (`Authorization` header / `httpCredentials`) are attached — credentialed scans always require a valid certificate to avoid leaking tokens to a MITM. | |
| SB_PREPOPULATED_SHA256 | Optional pinned SHA-256 hex digest for a pre-populated Safe Browsing DB zip. When set, any pre-populated zip whose contents do not match the digest is rejected, closing the risk of a locally-planted or stale archive silently disabling Safe Browsing. | |

#### Environment variables used internally (Do not set)

```

Choose `Mobile` for a default mobile screen size scan and `Custom` to choose a device or specify viewport width options.

### Custom flow

Custom flow allows you to specify a user journey by enabling you to click the scan button on each desired webpage on a browser to initiate scan. This is useful to scan websites that require user and form input.

1. Start by choosing the `Custom flow` in the menu selection.

```shell
% npm start
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Oobee (ver      )                                   │
│ We recommend using Chrome browser for the best experience. │
│                                                            │
│ Welcome back User!                                         │
│ (Refer to readme.txt on how to change your profile)        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
? What would you like to scan?
  Sitemap
  Website
❯ Custom
```

1. Specify the URL of the starting page you wish to scan
2. A Chrome window will appear. Navigate through the pages and click on the **Scan this page** button at the top right of the broswer's page to conduct an accessibility scan on the current page.
3. You may drag the top black bar to the bottom of the page in the event it prevents you from viewing / blocking certain page elements.
4. Close the Chrome window to end the scan.

Other options:

- You can specify sites to exclude from accessibility scan (e.g. login page) by adding a pattern of the domain to `exclusions.txt`. An example of `exclusions.txt`:

```txt
\.*login.singpass.gov.sg\.*
```

#### Known Issues

If the custom flow fails to start, you might be running multiple versions of Playwright. Re-install Playwright:

1. On Windows, delete the folder `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` where `%USERPROFILE%` is typically located at `C:\Users\<username>`.
2. On MacOS, delete the folder `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` where `~` refers to `/Users/<username>`.
3. Within PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) app, run the following two commands to re-install Playwright:

```Shell
npx playwright@1.27.1 install
```

### CLI Mode

CLI mode is designed to be run in continuous integration (CI) environment.
Run `npm run cli` for a set of command-line parameters available.

                                     To obtain the JSON files, you need to base64-decode
                                     the file followed by gunzip. For example:
                                     (macOS) base64 -D -i scanData.json.gz.b64 |
                                     gunzip > scanData.json\n
                                     (linux) base64 -d scanData.json.gz.b64 |
                                     gunzip > scanData.json\n

                                     nlimited)             [number] [default: 0]
  -z, --websiteTag                   Tag to identify the website in telemetry.
                                     Overrides OOBEE_TAGGED_WEBSITE env var.
                                                                       [string]

Examples:
  To scan sitemap of website:', 'npm run cli -- -c [ 1 | sitemap ] -u <url_lin
  k> [ -d <device> | -w <viewport_width> ]
  To scan a website', 'npm run cli -- -c [ 2 | website ] -u <url_link> [ -d <d
  evice> | -w <viewport_width> ]
  To start a custom flow scan', 'npm run cli -- -c [ 3 | custom ] -u <url_link
  > [ -d <device> | -w <viewport_width> ]

```

### Basic Auth

For sites behind HTTP Basic Authentication, you can provide credentials in two ways:

1. **Embed in URL**: `npm run cli -- -u 'https://user:password@example.com' -c 3`
2. **Use `-m` flag**: `npm run cli -- -u 'https://example.com' -c 3 -m "Authorization Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="`

Both methods work across all scan types (sitemap, website, custom flow). For multiple headers, separate with `, `:
```
-m "Authorization Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz, X-Custom-Header myvalue"
```

> **Note:** Authorization headers are only sent to same-origin requests to avoid CORS preflight failures on cross-origin resources (e.g., CDN fonts, analytics scripts).

### Note on Windows PowerShell:
You need to run the command as `npm run cli -- --` (with the extra set of `--`) as PowerShell interprets arguments differently.

</details>

If the device name contains `(` and `)`, wrap the device name in single quotes when entered into the CLI.
Please note that `-d` and `-w` are mutually exclusive. If none are specified, the default device used for the CLI scan is Desktop.

For example, to conduct a website scan to the URL "http://localhost:8000" and write to "oobee-scan-results.zip" with an 'iPad (gen 7) landscape' screen, run

```shell
npm run cli -- -c 2 -o oobee-scan-results.zip -u http://localhost:8000 -d 'iPad (gen 7) landscape'
```

If the site you want to scan has a query string wrap the link in single quotes when entered into the CLI.

For example, to conduct a website scan to the URL "http://localhost:8000" and write to "oobee-scan-results.zip" with a custom screen width '360', run

```shell
npm run cli -- -c 2 -o oobee-scan-results.zip -u "http://localhost:8000" -w 360
```

## Report

Once a scan of the site is completed.

A report will be downloaded into the current working directory.

## Accessibility Scan Results

Each Issue has its own severity "Must Fix" / "Good to Fix" based on the [WCAG 2.2 Conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

For details on which accessibility scan results triggers a "Must Fix" / "Good to Fix" findings, you may refer to [Scan Issue Details](./DETAILS.md).

## Troubleshooting

Please refer to the information below to assist in debugging. Most errors below are due to the switching between Node.js versions.

### Incompatible Node.js versions

**Issue**: When your Node.js version is incompatible, you may face the following syntax error.

```shell
const URL_NO_COMMAS_REGEX = RegExp('https?://(www\\.)?[\\p{L}0-9][-\\p{L}0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{0,254}[\\p{L}0-9]\\.[a-z]{2,63}(:\\d{1,5})?(/[-\\p{L}0-9@:%_\\+.~#?&//=\\(\\)]*)?', 'giu'); // eslint-disable-line
                            ^
SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /https?://(www\.)?[\p{L}0-9][-\p{L}0-9@:%\._\+~#=]{0,254}[\p{L}0-9]\.[a-z]{2,63}(:\d{1,5})?(/[-\p{L}0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=\(\)]*)?/: Invalid escape
```

**Solution**: Install Node.js versions >= 20, i.e. Node.js v20 and above.

### Compiled against a different Node.js version

**Issue**: When you switch between different versions of Node.js in your environment, you may face the following error.

```shell
<user_path>/oobee/node_modules/bindings/bindings.js:91
        throw e
        ^

Error: The module '<module_file_path>'
was compiled against a different Node.js version using
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 57. This version of Node.js requires
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 88. Please try re-compiling or re-installing
the module (for instance, using `npm rebuild` or `npm install`).
```

**Solution**: As recommended in the error message, run `npm rebuild` or `npm install`

### Oobee Exits Without An Error

**Issue**: Oobee does not start a scan as shown below

```shell
> @govtechsg/oobee@0.10.68 cli
> node --max-old-space-size=10000 dist/cli.js -c -u https://example.com
```

**Solutions**:

1. Delete existing `node_modules` folder and re-install the npm packages with `npm install`.

2. Set Oobee Verbose mode so more errors are shown during a scan 
#### On MacOS:
```
export OOBEE_VERBOSE=1
```
#### On Windows
```
$env:OOBEE_VERBOSE=1
```

3. Re-run a scan and see if the issue is resolved.

4. Get the error log information. Error log is available at the log file that is written to `<uuid>.txt`
```
{"timestamp":"2025-09-26 11:13:57","level":"info","message":"Logger writing to: /Users/.../Oobee/...txt"}
```

5. Open an [https://github.com/GovTechSG/oobee/issues](issue). Describe the steps to the problem and paste a copy of the error log.


### Element Screenshot Limitation

**Limitation**: Due to animations causing elements to shift out of the viewport after an Axe scan, there's a risk of element screenshots timing out within 5 seconds if the element is not found. This known issue is particularly prevalent in scenarios like carousels with interval-based transitions.

## FAQ

### How do I limit number of pages scanned?

If you find a scan takes too long to complete due to large website, or there are too many pages in a sitemap to scan, you may choose to limit number of pages scanned.

To do this, run CLI mode `npm run cli --` with the needed settings and specify `-p 10` where `10` is the number of pages you wish to scan.

### I am a new developer and I have some knowledge gap.

We recommend looking at our **Technology Stack** to understand the usage of each component. Take your time to understand.

## Additional Information on Data

Oobee uses third-party open-source tools that may be downloaded over the Internet during the installation process of Oobee. Users should be aware of the libraries used by examining `package.json`.

Oobee may send information to the website or URL where the user chooses to initiate a Oobee scan. Limited user information such as e-mail address, name, and basic analytics is collected for the purpose of knowing our usage patterns better.

## Development and Testing Helpers

Useful helpers for Oobee developers
### Generate new HTML
When working on EJS (HTML, CSS, JS), use the following helper script to test your changes so that you do not need to run a full scan to get the new report in results directory.

It uses the existing report *.json files for the embedded HTML dataset.

```
npx tsx dev/runGenerateJustHtmlReport.ts results/<report directory>
```
