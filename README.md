# Oobee

[Oobee](https://go.gov.sg/oobee-cli) (formerly known as Purple A11y) is a customisable, automated accessibility testing tool that allows software development teams to assess whether their products are user-friendly to persons with disabilities (PWDs).

This is the engine and command-line interface (CLI) for Oobee. For a desktop graphical user interface (GUI), check out [Oobee Desktop](https://go.gov.sg/oobee). The official application can only be downloaded at [https://go.gov.sg/oobee-cicd](https://go.gov.sg/oobee-cicd). We recommend that you download the software only from the official link, as other sources and/or third party links may pose risks and/or compromise your system.

## Using Oobee as a NodeJS module

If you wish to use Oobee as a NodeJS module that can be integrated with end-to-end testing frameworks, refer to the [integration guide](./INTEGRATION.md) on how you can do so.

## Prerequisites and Installations

### Portable Oobee

Portable Oobee is the recommended way to run Oobee as it reduces the difficulty for installation. Refer to [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md) for step-by-step instructions for portable Oobee.

### Manual Installation

Please ensure the following requirements are met:

#### Node.js

- A Node distribution of 20 (LTS) or above.
- To check your version of Node, go into terminal and paste the command bellow

```shell
node -v
```

- If you do not have node, or if there is a need to manage your node versions, you can consider using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). After NVM is installed, you can then install an LTS version of Node:

```shell
# Install NodeJS version with NVM
nvm install --lts

# For subsequent use, you will need to run the command below each time you open a new terminal
nvm use --lts
```

- Install the required NPM packages with `npm install`.
- Build the project with `npm run build` before you try to run it with `npm start`.

#### Java JRE/JDK

- A JRE/JDK distribution of version 11 or above.
- To check your version of Java, go into terminal and paste the command bellow

```shell
java --version
```

- If you do not have java, you can consider installing [Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/what-is-corretto-11.html) distribution of OpenJDK.

#### VeraPDF

- VeraPDF is used for scanning PDF files. Install VeraPDF by following the [install guide](https://docs.verapdf.org/install/). You may wish to use the Automated installation script provided on that page, and changing the XML installation script section `<installpath>/tmp/verapdf-test</installpath>` to a location of your choice.
- Ensure you have VeraPDF set in PATH then verify verapdf is installed correctly:

```shell
# Invoke the VeraPDF installer
# Windows users should use vera-install.bat instead of vera-install
./verapdf-install ./auto-install.xml

# Add VeraPDF to PATH. For subsequent use, you will need to run the command below each time you open a new terminal
export PATH="<location of verapdf>:$PATH"

# Verify verapdf is installed
verapdf --version
```

#### Facing issues?

Please refer to [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for more information.

## Features

Oobee can perform the following to scan the target URL.

- To **run** Oobee in **terminal**, run `npm start`. Questions will be prompted to assist you in providing the right inputs.
- Results will be compiled in JSON format, followed by generating a HTML report.

> NOTE: For your initial scan, there may be some loading time required before use. Oobee will also ask for your name and email address and collect your app usage data to personalise your experience. Your information fully complies with [GovTech’s Privacy Policy](https://www.tech.gov.sg/privacy/).

#### Delete/Edit Details

> You may delete and edit your cached name and e-mail address by running the following command to delete `userData.txt`:

> - Windows (PowerShell): `rm "$env:APPDATA\Oobee\userData.txt"`
> - MacOS (Terminal): `rm "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Oobee/userData.txt"`

If `userData.txt` does not exists just run `npm start`.

### Customised Mobile Device Scan

```shell
% npm start
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Oobee (ver      )                                   │

❯ Desktop
  Mobile
  Custom
```

Choose `Mobile` for a default mobile screen size scan and `Custom` to choose a device or specify viewport width options.

### Custom flow

Custom flow allows you to specify a user journey by enabling you to click the scan button on each desired webpage on a browser to initiate scan. This is useful to scan websites that require user and form input.

1. Start by choosing the `Custom flow` in the menu selection.

```shell
% npm start
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Oobee (ver      )                                   │
│ We recommend using Chrome browser for the best experience. │
│                                                            │
│ Welcome back User!                                         │
│ (Refer to readme.txt on how to change your profile)        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
? What would you like to scan?
  Sitemap
  Website
❯ Custom
```

1. Specify the URL of the starting page you wish to scan
2. A Chrome window will appear. Navigate through the pages and click on the **Scan this page** button at the top right of the broswer's page to conduct an accessibility scan on the current page.
3. You may drag the top black bar to the bottom of the page in the event it prevents you from viewing / blocking certain page elements.
4. Close the Chrome window to end the scan.

Other options:

- You can specify sites to exclude from accessibility scan (e.g. login page) by adding a pattern of the domain to `exclusions.txt`. An example of `exclusions.txt`:

```txt
\.*login.singpass.gov.sg\.*
```

#### Known Issues

If the custom flow fails to start, you might be running multiple versions of Playwright. Re-install Playwright:

1. On Windows, delete the folder `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` where `%USERPROFILE%` is typically located at `C:\Users\<username>`.
2. On MacOS, delete the folder `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` where `~` refers to `/Users/<username>`.
3. Within PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) app, run the following two commands to re-install Playwright:

```Shell
npx playwright@1.27.1 install
```

If the device name contains `(` and `)`, wrap the device name in single quotes when entered into the CLI.
Please note that `-d` and `-w` are mutually exclusive. If none are specified, the default device used for the CLI scan is Desktop.

For example, to conduct a website scan to the URL "http://localhost:8000" and write to "oobee-scan-results.zip" with an 'iPad (gen 7) landscape' screen, run

```shell
npm run cli -- -c 2 -o oobee-scan-results.zip -u http://localhost:8000 -d 'iPad (gen 7) landscape'
```

If the site you want to scan has a query string wrap the link in single quotes when entered into the CLI.

For example, to conduct a website scan to the URL "http://localhost:8000" and write to "oobee-scan-results.zip" with a custom screen width '360', run

```shell

## Troubleshooting

Please refer to the information below to assist in debugging. Most errors below are due to the switching between Node.js versions.

### Incompatible Node.js versions

**Issue**: When your Node.js version is incompatible, you may face the following syntax error.

```shell
const URL_NO_COMMAS_REGEX = RegExp('https?://(www\\.)?[\\p{L}0-9][-\\p{L}0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{0,254}[\\p{L}0-9]\\.[a-z]{2,63}(:\\d{1,5})?(/[-\\p{L}0-9@:%_\\+.~#?&//=\\(\\)]*)?', 'giu'); // eslint-disable-line
                            ^
SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /https?://(www\.)?[\p{L}0-9][-\p{L}0-9@:%\._\+~#=]{0,254}[\p{L}0-9]\.[a-z]{2,63}(:\d{1,5})?(/[-\p{L}0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=\(\)]*)?/: Invalid escape
```

**Solution**: Install Node.js versions >= 20, i.e. Node.js v20 and above.

### Compiled against a different Node.js version

**Issue**: When you switch between different versions of Node.js in your environment, you may face the following error.

```shell
<user_path>/oobee/node_modules/bindings/bindings.js:91
        throw e
        ^

Error: The module '<module_file_path>'
was compiled against a different Node.js version using
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 57. This version of Node.js requires
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 88. Please try re-compiling or re-installing
the module (for instance, using `npm rebuild` or `npm install`).
```

**Solution**: As recommended in the error message, run `npm rebuild` or `npm install`

### dyld Error

**Issue**: Not able to run Oobee due to the following error shown below

```shell
dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: __ZN2v87Isolate37AdjustAmountOfExternalAllocatedMemoryEx
  Referenced from: <user_path>/oobee/node_modules/libxmljs/build/Release/xmljs.node
  Expected in: flat namespace

dyld: Symbol not found: __ZN2v87Isolate37AdjustAmountOfExternalAllocatedMemoryEx
  Referenced from: <user_path>/PURPLE_A11y/oobee/node_modules/libxmljs/build/Release/xmljs.node
  Expected in: flat namespace

zsh: abort      node index.js
```

**Solutions**:

1. Delete existing `node_modules` folder and re-install the NPM packages with `npm install`.
2. Refer to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/issues/313) for more alternative solutions

### Element Screenshot Limitation

**Limitation**: Due to animations causing elements to shift out of the viewport after an Axe scan, there's a risk of element screenshots timing out within 5 seconds if the element is not found. This known issue is particularly prevalent in scenarios like carousels with interval-based transitions.

## FAQ

### How do I limit number of pages scanned?

If you find a scan takes too long to complete due to large website, or there are too many pages in a sitemap to scan, you may choose to limit number of pages scanned.

To do this, run CLI mode `npm run cli --` with the needed settings and specify `-p 10` where `10` is the number of pages you wish to scan.

### I am a new developer and I have some knowledge gap.
